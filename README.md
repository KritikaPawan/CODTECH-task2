CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION AND ANALYSIS

The objective of this project is to perform customer segmentation analysis on a retail dataset to identify distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior. By utilizing clustering techniques like K-means or DBSCAN, the aim is to group customers into meaningful segments. This analysis will help uncover segment characteristics such as purchasing frequency, average transaction value, and product preferences. Ultimately, the insights gained will enable the development of targeted marketing strategies tailored to the specific needs and behaviors of each customer segment.
